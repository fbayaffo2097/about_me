# 🐱 Hello, World! 🌍

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a student who's passionate about coding, particularly in Ruby on Rails. But that's not all! I'm also a huge cat lover. Why? Because cats make everything better, that's why!

## 😺 About Me

I believe in the power of programming to create meaningful and impactful applications. I'm currently learning Ruby on Rails and I'm loving every minute of it. When I'm not coding, you can find me cuddling with my cats, reading a good book, or exploring the great outdoors.

## 🐾 My Coding Journey

I started my coding journey with Ruby and have since fallen in love with the language. I'm now diving into Ruby on Rails and am excited to see where this journey takes me. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.

## 🐈 Fun Cat Fact

Did you know that a group of cats is called a clowder? I didn't invent the English language, I promise.

## 🐱‍👤 Get in Touch

I'm always open to collaborating on projects and ideas or just chatting about code. Feel free to reach out to me. And remember, always be as cool as a cat!
